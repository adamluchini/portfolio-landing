     <h2>What I do for fun:</h2>
     <p class="body-text">The feisty blonde to the left of this text is my daughter, Mae. Her and I do a bunch of fun stuff when she comes over on the weekends. The amount of exciting activies we do is limitless, but if this site required some sort of, I don't know, ordered list, they would be ranked as follows:</p>
      <ol class="body-text ol-list">
        <li>Filming funny bits</li>
        <li>Watching the cartoon "Adventure Time"</li>
        <li>Playing soccer and two square</li>
      </ol>

     <h2>Places I've been:</h2>
     <p class="body-text">A lot of my friends compare me to that little gnome from the Travelocity commericials. It's not because I'm chubby and short, but from how much I travel. I've been all around the world. The <span class="italic">Oregon Coast?</span> Seen it. <span class="italic">Bend?</span> You betcha. </span>... Not exotic enough? Alright, get ready. We also have <span class="italic">Seattle</span>. I've been there! It's called the Emerald City and it has a lot of professional sportsball teams. Okay well, <span class="italic">Tacoma</span> is on the way up there so that counts. I think I saw <span class="italic">Nevada</span> while on a plane? I can't confirm or deny that. Oh! You know what, I went to <span class="italic">Chicago</span>. If you don't believe, check out that image to the right. That's at Cloudgate. You know, The Bean! Yep it sure is!</p>

     <h2>A fun purchase I recently made:</h2>
      <img class="img-standup" src="img/standup.jpg" alt="comedy albums">
     <p class="body-text">As you can see above, I've been on a kick of finding stand-up comedy albums on vinyl. There isn't a whole lot out there, but these three are currently on my wall. That Steve Martin album was found at a local record store on Belmont for only $5! Unfortunately, the shop shut down shortly I made the purchase. My patronage wasn't enough to keep it afloat.</p>
    <h2>Life before Epicodus</h2>
    <p class="body-text"> Prior to Epicodus I was <strong>literally</strong> saving people's lives by installing radon mitigations systems. I enjoyed it very much, but doing computer bleeps and bloops is fun too!
