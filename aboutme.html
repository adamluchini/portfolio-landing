     <h2>What I do for fun</h2>
     <p class="body-text">The feisty blonde to the left of this text is my daughter, Mae. Her and I do a bunch of fun stuff when she comes over on the weekends. The amount of exciting activies we do is limitless, but if this site required some sort of, I don't know, ordered list, they would be ranked as follows:</p>
      <ol class="body-text ol-list">
        <li>Filming comedy bits</li>
        <li>Watching the cartoon "Adventure Time"</li>
        <li>Playing soccer and two square</li>
      </ol>

     <h2>Places I've been</h2>
     <p class="body-text">A lot of my friends compare me to that little gnome from the Travelocity commericials. It's not because I'm chubby and short, but from how much I travel. I've been all around the world. The <span class="italic">Oregon Coast?</span> Seen it. <span class="italic">Bend?</span> You betcha. </span>... Not exotic enough? Alright, get ready. We also have <span class="italic">Seattle</span>. I've been there! It's called the Emerald City and it has a lot of professional sportsball teams. Okay well, <span class="italic">Tacoma</span> is on the way up there so that counts. I think I saw <span class="italic">Nevada</span> while on a plane? I can't confirm or deny that. Oh! You know what, I went to <span class="italic">Chicago</span>. If you don't believe, check out that image to the right. That's at Cloudgate. You know, The Bean! Yep it sure is!</p>

     <p class="body-text">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure</p>
